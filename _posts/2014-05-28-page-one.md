Hello world!

This is my first blog on GitHub! \\( f(x\_i, W) =  W x\_i \\)

Concretely, recall that the linear function had the form \\( f(x_i,W) = W x_{ {i_1} ^2} \\) and the SVM we developed was formulated as:

$$
L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \sum_{j\neq y_i} \left[ \max(0, f(x_i; W)_j - f(x_i; W)_{y_i} + 1) \right] + \alpha R(W)


$$

$$
p = y_i
$$
