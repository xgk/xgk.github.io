Recently I studied how [CNTK](https://cntk.codeplex.com) implemented the [1-Bit SGD](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=230137) in sync mode. 
Here is a note  of the implementation.

Most of the implementation is in files, `1BitSGD\AllReduceDistGradAggregator.h` & `1BitSGD\MatrixQuantizer.h`

#### 1.  Background

The Gradients of each layer in CNTK is stored as a **Maxtrix of MxN**, e.g. *M inputs, N outputs*. And the quantization of gradients is *based on each column*, e.g. each output. 

There are several steps during distributed aggregation,

*   Encoding local sub-gradients of each **Mini-Batch** using **1 Bit** by quantization. 
*   Send local quantized sub-gradients to other computation node in *striped* mode to get aggregated.
*   Receive a strip of quantized sub-gradients from other nodes.
*   Decoding each received strip of quantized sub-gradients by unquantization, then **add the unquantized results to aggregated gradients strip**.
*   Encoding the strip of aggregated gradients using 1 bits by quantization.
*   Broadcast the quantized aggregated gradients strip to other nodes.
*   Receiving the quantized aggregated gradients strips from other nodes, and merge them to local quantized gradient matrix.
*   Decoding the aggregated local quantized gradient matrix as an approximation of the global gradients.

#### 2.  Quantization&UnQuantization

The quantization is based on each column. E.g.

    Q = 0 if V>=0
    Q = 1 if V<0

The max and min values of that column are stored together with the quantized results. See, `QuantizedColumn`
The unquantization will use the max and min values of that column, e.g. (See `ValueQuantizer`)
$$
Vâ€™ = (Q+0.5)*(max-min)/2 + min;
$$

#### 3.  Strip

A strip is a group of columns in the gradient matrix, which is decided by the number of distributed computation nodes. 
For example, suppose there are 4 nodes, and 8 columns, then each nodes will have a strip of 2 columns. 

#### 4.  Residual 

The residual of each column is calculated during quantization and used for the quantization of next mini-batch by adding it to the local sub-gradients of that column.

#### 5.  An example of message exchange

Here is an example picture of the message exchange during aggregation. 

![Example of 1Bit SGD Message Exchange]({{Site.Url}}/assets/images/Example_of_1Bit_SGD_Message_Pass.png)

*Node0* will collect quantized local-sub-gradients of *Strip0* from all other 3 *nodes*. 
Then unquantizes each of them and add results to aggregated results of *strip0*.
Then quantize the aggregated results of *Strip0*, e.g. *AggStrip0* and broadcast it to other 3 *nodes*.
